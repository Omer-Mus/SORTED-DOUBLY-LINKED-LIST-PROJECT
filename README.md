# SORTED-DOUBLY-LINKED-LIST-PROJECT

SORTED DOUBLY LINKED LIST PROJECT


Design and implement a class representing a sorted doubly linked list. The class must have the following requirements:

1.	The linked list and the nodes must be implemented as  C++ templates
2.	It must include a constructor, a destructor, a copy constructor and an operator=
3.	It must include functions to insert a given item, delete the first  occurrence of a given item, delete all occurrences of a given item, search for a given item, empty the list, check if the list is empty, return the length of the list. 
4.	It must provide an iterator to access items from front to back
5.	It must provide an iterator to access items from back to front


Write a menu-driven program to test all the functions in your class ,including the copy constructor and the operator= 
To test your iterators, include in your menu options to print in ascending or descending order.
